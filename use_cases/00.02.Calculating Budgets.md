# Calculating Budgets

    Given a Measure assigned to an Entity and a Period of interest
    When the Period is complete
    Then the Measure conversion Lambda is calculated on the AccountingEntries for that Period and Entity
    And LedgerEntries are written to store the budget or KPI

    Given a Measure assigned to an Entity and a Period of interest
    When progress is being checked
    Then the Measure conversion Lambda is calculated on the AccountingEntries for that Period and Entity
    And the results are returned without storing information to LedgerEntries

## Dealing with Ambiguity

A Measure can be a Budget or KPI. We haven't designed these yet, the product could be built in many ways. We have designed flexibility in the types of calculations generated, but possibly we would need extra support. This is what the meta data field is for, a JSON object that might make the Lambda conversion work.

The same problems with calling out to a Lambda for an AccountingType (00.00.Capture a Transaction) apply here: we are designing flexibility, and as long as there aren't many ways to do this, this will work.

## Relationships

* A Measure has many MeasureAssignments
* A Measure has many Entities through MeasureAssignments
* A Measure has many MeasureResults which belongs to a Period
* A Measure has many LedgerEntries through MeasureResults
* A MeausureResult belongs to a MeaureAssignment
* A MeasureResult belongs to an Entity through MeasureAssignment
